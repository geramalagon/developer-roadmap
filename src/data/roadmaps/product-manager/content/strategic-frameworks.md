### Strategic Frameworks

Strategic frameworks help Product Managers structure decisions, uncover insights, and communicate direction clearly. Mastering these tools improves your ability to analyze markets, shape product direction, and align stakeholders.

Common frameworks include:

- **SWOT Analysis** – Assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
- **Porter's Five Forces** – Understand industry competition and profitability.
- **Business Model Canvas** – Visualize how a product delivers and captures value.
- **MECE Principle** – Ensure ideas and categories are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
- **First Principles Thinking** – Break problems down to their most basic truths.
- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)** – Align goals across the organization.
- **Value Proposition Canvas** – Map product features to user pains and gains.

Use these as thinking tools, not checklists. Choose based on the decision you're supporting and the clarity your team needs.
